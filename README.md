# bamazon
node.js &amp; mysql homework

the "photos" folder contains the step-by-step process of my bamazon app

my code is contained within the "assets" folder

below the code is a section displaying my trial-and-error methodology

I tried to add a yes/no prompt to either restart or quit the app, but due to asynchronisity I couldn't get the order to work properly or for the resulting functionality to process
